My first proper job ended with a brief phone call. Unlike most calls, it wasn’t actually a conversation. It was a professional dressing down punctuated by awkward sobbing.

I listened as the Managing Director told me he could see no way back for me in his agency. I had no response to his end-of-tether honesty. It took only a few crushing blows before he delivered the inevitable result.

As he ended the call, I stood there – scared, upset and sacked.

This was only six months after he’d called to offer me a job. In that conversation he talked about how impressed they were in my interview. I’d replied with how excited I was to work for them.

How had things gone so wrong so fast?

I’ve thought about this a lot over the last six years.

###What went wrong in Manchester?

Getting the job in Manchester felt like a big achievement and an even bigger relief. For the first time in a while I had clear sight of the future. It was free from the dizzying aura of impending unemployment after finishing university.
